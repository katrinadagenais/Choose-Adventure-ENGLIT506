    <p id="story"> You have been selected for a top secret mission. The scientists explain 
	to you in confidentiality that many widely marketted children's games
    are based on reality, though they are realities different then our own. 
    These alternate universes have all been conversing for quite some time, 
    and our universe is the one assigned as protector to all the others. 
    That is why they make games based on these worlds, they explained, so 
    if they need to send someone in to protect one of the universes, they
    would have an amount of familiarity with the place to which they must 
    travel. They explain that no matter how much they are based on these
    real worlds, the games are nothing like the universes that ours is responsible 
    for. Though our universe is not often called upon to protect, the 
    scientists are always on the lookout for a distress signal. They were
     surprised to now have recieved one from the most peaceful of places, 
    Candyland.<br/><br/>The Candyland signal was weak and unclear, but it did
    indicate distress. Your job is to travel to Candyland, find out what
    is amiss there, and report back. <br/><br/>The scientists are very firm that once
    you know the problem you should take no action and simply report back.
    They give you a device coverd in many buttons and point to a circular
    yellow button. "This button will take you back to our universe. Press 
    it when you have the information or are in too much distress to continue
     your mission. This is the only button you may press."<br/><br/>With 
    that, they open the door to the Wormhole Room (another heavily guarded
    secret) and wish you luck. You close your eyes and walk forward until you 
    are caught off guard by the smell of sugar.<br/><br/>You open your eyes and 
    see Candyland. You are surprised by how much it seems like the game. 
    You see the Lollypop Woods, the Snowflake Lake, the Gumdrop mountains
     in the distance, and can smell peppermint.
    You begin to wonder if the scientists could have been wrong, about both
    Candyland being different from the game and about its being in trouble.</p>

function Disguise(){
	story.innerHTML='You are confident that you\
	would not have been assigned this mission if the scientists who sent you\
	here to Candyland didn\'t trust your judgment, even though it sometime \
	contradicts with theirs. They have sent you to an unfamiliar place completely\
	alone, so you have the right to do what you think is best once you get there.\
	<br/><br/> In your professional opinion, you will seem as unfamiliar to the residents \
	of Candyland as their world seems to you, and chances are good they \
	will not trust you. You disguise yourself as the person from your world \
	you think would fit in best in Candyland: Buddy the Elf.<br/><br/> It\
	\'s a good thing you\'re always prepared. <br/><br/> You walk through the open \
	field towards the Gumdrop Mountains, making sure to remain as visible as\
	possible. You are hoping to find whoever sent the distress call, and \
	perhaps looking like this they will find you. You\'re hoping anyone\
	will find you. This place you have arrived in seems too quiet and pristine.\
	You find it hard to believe anyone lives here at all, even candy people.<br/><br/> \
	You look at the device that will bring you home and remind yourself that you\
	are favoring your own judgment over your previous orders. You start \
	        pushing buttons, slowly and carefully, taking time between each \
	        press to look out for any effects on yourself or your surroundings. \
	        The first six you press seem to do nothing, at least nothing that you \
	        can notice. <br/><br/>When you touch your finger to the seventh button, before you \
	        can even press it, your perception changes. The world as you see it \
	        darkens and distorts, and you hear a sound somewhere between a high\
	         pitched cackle and a grumbling thunder. It is the kind of sound \
	         you never could have imagined beyond conceptually, like the idea\
	         of seeing a new color. This experience seems even more impossible \
	         than the Candyland you entered. You blink and it disappears. \
	         Candyland is as serene as when you arrived. You wonder if really \
	         pushing the button will permanently alter your perception and if \
	         it\'s some kind of trick to throw you off. ';

function Eat(){
	story.innerHTML='THE ENTIRE WORLD IS MADE OF CANDY! You were aware \
	that this would be the case, but you are amazed by the reality of it. \
	You begin to eat. <br/><br/>Everything tastes sweeter than you expect \
	it to; somehow it is all infinitely better than its counterparts in your \
	universe. In the back of your mind, you wonder if you\'ll ever be satisfied \
	with candy again once you go home. Then you wonder why you would ever \
	leave this place. <br/><br/>You eat and you eat and you eat. You never \
	want to stop eating. Can you stop eating? You\'re not sure, but why would \
	you stop eating?<br/><br/>All you can think of is eating. You lose all \
	concept of purpose, of time, and of yourself. Sugar grass, chocolate dirt, \
	jelly bean bugs. <br/><br/>You\'re devouring a licorice vine when you \
	hear a sound in the distance. A tune, more like. You can place it immediately, \
	it\'s an ice cream truck! The licorice drops from your hand and you regain \
	yourself, remembering your mission. Whatever trance the candy had placed \
	on you was broken the second you were within earshot of the song. \
	<br/><br/>Since you are here to investigate, and you personally would \
	like to know what just done to you and how the sound undid it, you begin \
	to follow the tune to its source. It is coming from the Lollipop Woods, \
	which you enter carefully. You keep walking until you see a clearing just \
	ahead, near the heart of the woods. In the middle, there is a girl \
	with pink curly hair. The song is coming from her, only she \
	doesn\'t seem to be singing. From this distance, she looks as if she is \
	crying, and as if the tune is her sobs. ';
