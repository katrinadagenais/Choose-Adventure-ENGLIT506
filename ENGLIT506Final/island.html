    <p>While on a remote island vacation, you heard about a little boat 
    that was offering an afternoon tour to see all of the nearby islands.
    The captain greeted you at the dock and told you that you were lucky 
    to arrive when you did, because he only had one spot left on the boat.
    You climbed aboard.</p><p>The other passengers created an odd assortment
    of folks, from intellectuals, to millionaires, to someone who seemed
    as though she might be a movie star. Altogether, there seemed to be about 
    twenty of you aboard the tiny ship.</p><p>It seemed to be a beautiful day,
    and you chatting with the captain as he steered around the small islands.
    </p><p>All of a sudden, the captain tensed. "This isn't right," he said
    to himself, barely audible. Noticing you had heard him, he said "I don't
    want anyone to panic, but there's a storm coming that I didn't anticipate. 
    I don't have enough time to get us to more shallow waters before it hits,
    and I don't know if the ship can take it."</p><p>You are about to respond when 
    the sky grumbles and the ship jerks beneath you. The sky opens above you and 
    a storm begins to rage. You are tossed in every direction as the capain 
    ushers you below deck. As the storm rages, you have no concept of how 
    much time is passing.<p>You wake up lying on a beach as the sun rises. 
    You see the ship, in pretty bad shape, a little ways down the beach. 
    The captain is near you, and seems to be alive, though he is not awake.
    You do not see any of the other passengers.</p>
