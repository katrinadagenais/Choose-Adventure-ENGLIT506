    <p id="story">You have been hearing murmurs that the circus was coming to town
    for weeks now. The strange thing was, if you asked someone when it 
    would actually arrive, they didn't know. No one did. They didn't even
    know which circus it was. All of this seemed a little odd to you, but 
    you often found yourself with very clueless friends, so you didn't 
    worry about it too much.<br/><br/>One day, you are out walking your dog around dusk
    and you are stopped by a very abnormal looking man. He is wearing a flashy
    suit in a pale red color, with tall collars and long tails, and on his head sits a tall
    hat of the same color. His face is pointed, shiny, and each feature
    seems, well, the only word you can think of is precise. His clothes 
    look faded and old, but not tattered. He seems as if he just walked
    out of a storage closet that has preserved him in perfect condition 
    for a length of time you couldn't guess. He looks down at you and grins.<br/><br/>
   "I'm from the circus," he tells you in a low, melodic voice.<br/><br/>"What circus?"
    you ask him, though he seems to have expected a different response.<br/><br/>"Why, 
    that one," he laughs, pointing. You turn to see a circus at the end of
    town, nearly entirely set up. The sign reads <i><b>Century Circus.</b></i> "Why don't you come, 
    and see it for yourself?"</p>

function Follow(){
	story.innerHTML='Your curiosity is too strong to resist, so you follow \
	the man to the circus. You\'re probably more concerned about your dog\'s \
	wellbeing than your own. The walk to the end of town seems strange, but \
	you cannot place why. It feels that when you return to these familiar \
	places after whatever you are about to do, neither they nor you will \
	be as they are in this moment. <br/><br/>From a distance, the circus \
	looks dull and sleepy, like it could no longer hold the life and fun \
	essential to a circus. Maybe it never could. It is situated just beyond \
	border where town ends, and when you pass the line, then you really see it.\
	<br/><br/>The difference isn\'t in the circus\' appearance, but rather in the \
	impression its appearance gives you. You can smell caramel and salt and hear \
	the murmur of performers within. It sounds like someone is playing piano, \
	jumping between silly tunes, none of which you recognize, but all of which \
	sound familiar. You can imagine the people inside now, chatting, grooming \
	the animals, laughing, singing, napping even. They\'re testing each other \
	skills, doubting the fortune teller and giggling about loosening the \
	tight rope wire. <br/><br/>You sense all of this, and you are still \
	standing outside the entrance of the circus. The man who brought you \
	there continues inside with long strides. Before you can follow him, you\'re \
	stopped by the ticket-keeper. It then occurs to you that you do not have \
	any money on you. You had only gone out to walk your dog. The ticket-keeper, \
	however, does not want you money. He smiles at your dog and tells you all you \
	have to do to enter the circus is to cross your heart, like you used to do \
	when you were a child making a promise. <br/><br/>You realize why the \
	walk to the circus was so strange. The man who brought you there walked silently.' ;

function Leave(){
	story.innerHTML='You wouldn\'t trust this stranger as far as you could \
	throw him, and he is much taller than you, so that would not be very far \
	at all. <br/><br/>You decline his offer and leave the park, holding your \
	dog\'s leash tightly. You notice your dog is pulling, trying to go back \
	to the man, but you do not look back until you are around a corner. You walk \
	home, taking a different route than normal in case you were followed. You make \
	it back and continue your day as you normally would. <br/><br/>In the following \
	days, you see people you do not recognize around town, presumably from the circus. \
	They are always alone, and if you see them somewhere, you may see that person again, \
	but never anywhere else besides that one location. You are hesitant to go back to \
	the park, but when you do, you see the man you spoke to there. You are careful to \
	avoid him. He does seem to be watching you, though. <br/><br/>You are surprised \
	that the town does not exhibit much enthusiasm for the circus. Your friends \
	have suggested to go a couple of times, but none of them ever really want to, \
	so you don\'t. Everyone knows that the circus is there, but oddly enough, \
	no one cares. <br/><br/>You notice that you are not seeing the older residents \
	of your town as much. Some of them are very old, you tell yourself, so they are \
	probably just too tired to go out much. <br/><br/>No one seems to know \
	when the circus will leave, but its departure feels inevitable.' ;
